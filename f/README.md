This problem tested people's abilities to read, use, and modify the kactl libraries, which we use in our ICPC notebook. To solve the problem, use the [`MinimumEnclosingCircle.h`](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/blob/main/content/geometry/MinimumEnclosingCircle.h) library to find the circular region of minimum radius, and then identify the other buildings which are in that circle by using distance formula to compute the distance from each building to the center of the circular region and then comparing that distance with the radius of the circle.

It is possible to encounter floating-point issues when solving this problem: As shown in `sol.cpp`, it is possible to solve this problem using floating-points but depending on how you choose your epsilon values for comparing the distance from the building to the center to the radius of the circle, you may accidentally include a building which is not in the circle or exclude a building which is in the circle. However, since floating-point accuracy was not the purpose of this problem, the test cases were written in a way to ensure there were no points which were too close to the boundary of the circle, so multiple people were still able to solve this problem in the contest without encountering floating-point issues.

To prevent this issue entirely, this problem can also be solved by rewriting the `MinimumEnclosingCircle.h` library in Java or Pypy 3 using arbitrary-precision integers, so that all the distances can be computed exactly without any floating-point errors. Interestingly, the Pypy 3 solution takes 468 ms while the Java solution takes 919 ms, so the Pypy 3 solution is almost twice as fast as the Java solution, likely because Java `BigInteger`s are quite slow.
