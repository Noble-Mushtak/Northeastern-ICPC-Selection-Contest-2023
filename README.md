# Northeastern ICPC Selection Contest 2023

This repository holds solutions to the problems in the Northeastern ICPC Selection Contest 2023, which was used to choose the most qualified students for Northeastern's ACM-ICPC teams. You can view the problems [by joining the contest using this invite link](https://codeforces.com/contestInvitation/4f92d75d4c884ac61fd7d89a9f6f735f64e87e45). All problems in the contest and solutions in this repository were written by Noble Mushtak.

The directory containing the solutions for each problem is named after the problem letter, e.g. the solutions to Problem A are in the `a` directory and the solutions to Problem G are in the `g` directory. Each directory contains a `README.md` briefly explaining the intuition behind the solution, a `sol.cpp` file representing a C++ solution to the problem, a `Solution.java` file representing a Java solution to the problem, and a `sol.py` file representing a Pypy 3 solution to the problem.
